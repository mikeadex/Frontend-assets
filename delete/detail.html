          In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's
          Conquest they have been Wardens of the North and ruled as Lords of
          Winterfell. Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of
          white. Their words are "Winter is Coming", one of only a few house
          mottoes to be a warning rather than a boast.
